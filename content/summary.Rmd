## About Me {.box}
I am primarily interested in data science and computational social science, broadly defined as the intersection between computer science and statistics, as applied to large-scale research in education. I am particularly interested in systematic inequalities that influence studentsâ€™ learning and growth over time. I am also a strong proponent of open and reproducible workflows.
