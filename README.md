# My CV
This is a repo for my CV, which uses a data-driven approach. In other words, entries are stored as data, which are then read into R and can be rendered in various ways. The entire CV is built with a combination of [pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown) with custom HTML and CSS. Basically, this allows PDFs to be generated using HTML and CSS code, as opposed something like LaTeX. 

Please feel free to fork/modify as much as you'd like, and get in touch if you have any questions.
